### Favorite Coding Project: Lists and Loops

```
num_list=[6,5,3,8,4,2,5,4,11,43,1,17,27,90,77,62,51,47,82,86,20]

print("Length of list :",len(num_list))
print("Sum of numbers in list :",sum(num_list))
print("Average of numbers in list :",sum(num_list)/len(num_list))
print("\n\nPrinting all list items using while loop:")
index = 0

while(index<len(num_list)):
    print("Item",index,":",num_list[index])
    index+=1
    print("\n\nPrinting every other list item:")
    
for i in range(0,len(num_list),2):
    print("Item",i,":",num_list[i])
    print("\n Printing even/odd numbers from list:")
for i in range(len(num_list)):
    if(num_list[i]%2==0):
        print(i,"is even")
    else:
        print(i,"is odd")
```

### Cryptocurrency Background:
   Cryptocurrencies have always fascinated me from an early age and this quickly became a huge hobby of mine and hopefully one day I can make a career out of it. I'm only 22 years old, but I've been investing in cryptocurrencies since I was 16 years old. After the years I decided to take my interests with crypto to the next level and started swingtrading the market when I was about 19.

### Coding Background:
   Coding is a very new hobby of mine only coming about in the past year or two. Since then I've been trying to learn C Code, JavaScript and HTML. I'm glad I decided to epand my skillset and give coding a try otherwise I might not have known that I enjoy it to a certain extent. My favorite coding language that I've learned so far would have to be HTML because I enjoy the web aspects of it and I would like to improve my skills in terms of web design.

### Future Coding Goals:
   In the future I hope to learn app development and expand my knowledge enough to where I am able to create custom professional platforms. This has always been something that I've been interested in; however, I never though I'd be capable of doing it. While I am still very far out from achieving this I hope with enough dedication and hard work I can accomplish.
