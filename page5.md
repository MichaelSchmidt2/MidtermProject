## Future Coding Goals:

In the future I hope to learn app development and expand my knowledge enough to where I am able to create custom professional platforms. This has always been something that I've been interested in; however, I never though I'd be capable of doing it. While I am still very far out from achieving this I hope with enough dedication and hard work I can accomplish.

It would be really cool to be able to tie all my different interests together and create a platform incorporating several different hobbies. As of right now these IT and computer science classes serve as a stepping stone toward the rest of my journey to reach my end goals.
