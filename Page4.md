## Previous Coding Experience:

Coding is a very new hobby of mine only coming about in the past year or two. Since then I've been trying to learn C Code, JavaScript and HTML. I'm glad I decided to epand my skillset and give coding a try otherwise I might not have known that I enjoy it to a certain extent. My favorite coding language that I've learned so far would have to be HTML because I enjoy the web aspects of it and I would like to improve my skills in terms of web design. 

**Coding Experience With:** 
	
* C Code
* JavaScript
* HTML
* Python

**Most Recent Code:**

This was my most recent project and it was written in C Code. This was probably the most challenging program for me to write so far; however, I was able to figure it out fairly quickly.

 *This was a program to create an array with custom numbers and to total the numbers and give you the average.*
