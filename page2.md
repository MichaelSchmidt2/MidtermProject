## About Me:

  My name is Michael Schmidt and I'm a Senior at the University of Missouri - Columbia. My major is in economics, as Im persuing a path in becoming a financial analyst. Coding has only ever been a hobby of mine but lately I've been more open to the idea of incorporating it into a career...
  
   Outside of coding I have a few other hobbies like trading cryptocurrencies and graphic design for my clothing brand called Censored Clothing. Until last year I never thought I'd be learning any coding languages or even enrolled in IT and computer science classes. I've become increasingly involved in IT over the years and have decided that tech is definitely going to play a major role in my career.
